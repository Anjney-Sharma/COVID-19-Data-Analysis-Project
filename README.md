# COVID-19 Data Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization project on COVID-19. The analysis includes data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization of key metrics to understand vaccination trends and pandemic insights.

## 📂 Project Structure
The Jupyter Notebook follows these main steps:
### 1.Data Cleaning
 Identifying and filtering the top 10 vaccinated countries

 Extracting one-year data

 Removing unnecessary columns

### 2.Data Quality Check
 Checking for missing values

 Filling missing values appropriately

### 3.KPI Requirements
 Generating insights based on key performance indicators (KPIs)

 Example: vaccination progress, case trends, and country comparisons

### 4.Visualization
 Creating visualizations to represent vaccination and COVID-19 trends

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
 Python 3

 Pandas – data cleaning and manipulation

 NumPy – numerical operations

 Matplotlib – data visualization

 Seaborn – advanced statistical plots

## 📊 Key Insights
 Identified the top 10 vaccinated countries and analyzed their progress.

 Cleaned and standardized the dataset for one-year focused analysis.

 Visualized COVID-19 vaccination and case trends using multiple charts.

 Built KPI-driven metrics for deeper insights into pandemic impact.

## 📦 Requirements
 Create a requirements.txt file with the following:

  pandas  
 
  numpy  
 
  matplotlib  
 
  seaborn  

## 📌 Future Improvements
 Add interactive dashboards (e.g., Plotly, Dash, or Streamlit)

 Automate data updates with APIs

 Extend KPIs for hospitalization and mortality analysis
